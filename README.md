## Documentation

### What and who is Verr Med for?
Verr Med was developed for people who struggle with drug allergies, with the end goal to ease their worries when buying medication and/or receiving treatment. Through the app, the user can type in the name of the drug they intend to take, add their allergies and make the search. The results will show all the matches to the name typed and will indicate wether each medication contains or not the allergens they input on the search field.

**IMPORTANT!**
Verr Med is *destinated only for informative purposes and does not encourage self medication.* We make the effort to keep the information provided simple and safe for the users, and *we do not take responsibility for any damage that might come from the misuse of the app*.

### Tech Stack
**Client**: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, ES6, ReactJS
API used to automate search: [Bulario API - documentation](https://bula.vercel.app/docs) | [Bulario API - GH](https://github.com/iuryLandin/bulario-api)

### How does it work?
1. The user types in the name of the drug they intend to take
    (the name typed must be an exact match OR a piece of the original name)
3. The user selects at least one allergen on the search field
    (not selecting prevents the user from searching and returns an error message)
5. The user hits the search button to start the search if all the fields are filled
